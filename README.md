**Building/Running the App**

I recommend using [Android Studio Guide](https://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-studio.html). 
You can also install the signed APK `app/app-debug.apk`

**Testing**

In Android Studio, right click on the test class `ConverterActivityTest` and run with the Android testing framework. I don't recommend using Gradle.
The Android framework can be finicky at times, depending on the device/emulator you use. If you run into this problem, it may be best to run each test method individually.
